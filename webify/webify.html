            <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a></span> was one of the most entertaining personalities in all
            of science. He was also one of the most brilliant. Hero to physics
            majors? None better. Feynman was a prankster, ladies’ man, and a
            straight-talking regular joe. But most importantly, he was an adept
            explainer and teacher of complex physics.
          </p>
          <p>As a five-year-old, Feynman fixed radios for neighborhood adults.</p>
          <p>
            “He fixes things with his mind!,” exclaimed one neighbor, since
            Feynman would sit for many minutes before fiddling with the
            electronics, imagining the current running through the circuitry,
            trying to imagine where it was broken.

                Before college, he derived advanced mathematical concepts using
                notation of his own design. He applied to Columbia but was
                rejected due to their “Jewish quota.” Instead he attended MIT,
                where he published two papers as an undergrad before heading off
                to <span><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton</a></span> for graduate school. Again, he was almost rejected
                for being Jewish, and would have been if not for the his advisors’
                recommendations.

            At Princeton, Feynman worked with John Wheeler on quantum
            electrodynamics, setting the foundation for the work that would
            eventually win him the Nobel. At this point, he was one of the
            smartest 23-year-olds in the country, if not the world, and had a more
            native and intuitive grasp of physics than anyone else, perhaps save
            for Einstein and Lev Landau. In 1941, the US entered WWII, and Feynman
            spent the summer working on military projects. A year later, he’d earn
            his PhD, and in 1943 he was recruited to join the Manhattan Project
            and went to Los Alamos to work on the atomic bomb.

          <p>It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how

            In Los Alamos, Feynman was assigned to Hans Bethe’s theoretical
            division, where he made enough of an impression to become a team
            leader. He was also sought out for one-on-one discussions with Niels
            Bohr, as most of the other physicists were too in awe of Bohr to have
            honest discussions and disagreements about physics. Feynman had no
            such inhibitions. He had a bunch of good stories from Los Alamos,
            including one in which he became a proficient enough lockpick to break
            into safes with US military secrets (one of the pranks he relates in
            Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!).
          </p>
          <p>
            After the war, he took a position at Cornell, where he had trouble
            focusing on research questions due to depression after the loss of his
            wife Arline, who died from tuberculosis. With his research stalled, he
            got back into solving physics problems for fun, rather than utility.
            One famous example was that of a spinning and nutating disk, which he
            cracked after seeing someone throw a dinner plate in the Cornell
            cafeteria. He claimed this inspired him to work with equations of
            rotations when thinking about electron spin—ultimately proving useful
            to his Nobel Prize-winning work in quantum electrodynamics.
